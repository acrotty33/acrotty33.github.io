	<p> This is an example of the JavaScript prompt method.</p>
	
	<!--
	<script type="text/javascript">
		prompt("Hi there! What's your name?");
	</script>

The above example is wrong because it doesn't actually use the name that you put into the text box.

	<script type="text/javascript">
		var name = prompt("Hi there! What's your name?");
		document.write("Welcome, " + name + "!" );
	</script>
